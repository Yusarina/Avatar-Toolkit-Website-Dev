            "question": "How does the Armature Validation System work?",
            "answer": "The armature validation system helps ensure your avatar's skeleton is properly set up for various platforms and features three validation modes:\n\n### Strict Mode\nProvides comprehensive validation including:\n- Checks for all essential bones (hips, spine, chest, neck, head)\n- Verifies correct bone hierarchy (e.g., spine properly connected to hips)\n- Ensures proper left/right bone symmetry\n- Validates bone naming conventions\n\n### Basic Mode\nPerforms essential checks:\n- Verifies presence of core bones\n- Basic structure validation\n- Allows more flexibility for non-standard avatars\n\n### No Validation\n- Bypasses all validation checks\n- Useful for experimental or non-humanoid avatars\n- Warning: May cause issues with some features\n\n[warning]Using No Validation mode may result in incompatibility with certain platforms or features not working as expected.[/warning]\n\n[note]The validation system supports multiple naming conventions and languages, making it compatible with avatars from various sources.[/note]",

            "question": "How do the Pose Mode Functions work?",
            "answer": "The pose mode system offers powerful tools for creating and managing poses:\n\n### Start/Stop Pose Mode\nWhen starting pose mode:\n- Automatically selects the armature\n- Enables bone manipulation\n- Preserves existing transformations\n\nWhen stopping pose mode:\n- Safely clears all pose adjustments\n- Returns bones to rest position\n- Preserves any saved poses\n\n### Creating Shape Keys from Poses\nThis powerful feature allows you to:\n- Convert any pose into a blendable shape key\n- Create multiple variations of the same pose\n- Combine poses with existing shape keys\n- Preserve vertex weights and deformations\n\n### Applying Poses as Rest Position\nThis function permanently changes your avatar's default pose:\n- Updates the base skeleton position\n- Adjusts all connected meshes\n- Preserves shape keys and their deformations\n- Maintains proper weight painting\n\n[warning]Applying a pose as rest position is permanent and cannot be undone after saving. Always make a backup before using this feature.[/warning]\n\n[note]Shape keys created from poses can be used for creating dynamic animations or blended expressions.[/note]",

            "answer": "The import/export system is designed to handle various avatar formats with specialized optimizations:\n\n### Import System\nSupports multiple formats with automatic optimization:\n\n**Standard Formats:**\n- FBX: Full support with automatic bone orientation\n- OBJ: Includes materials and textures\n- GLTF/GLB: Complete VRM support\n\n**MMD Formats:**\n- PMX: Full support for MMD features\n  - Automatic bone naming conversion\n  - Material optimization\n  - Shape key preservation\n  - Weight transfer optimization\n- PMD: Legacy format support with automatic upgrades\n\n[View complete list of supported formats](https://avatartoolkit.xyz/wiki.html?version=0.1.2#what-file-formats-are-supported-by-the-avatar-toolkit)\n\n### Export System\nOffers two main export paths:\n\n**FBX Export:**\n- Optimized for various platforms\n- Preserves all materials and textures\n- Maintains bone hierarchies\n- Includes shape keys and weights\n\n**Resonite Export:**\n- Specialized format for Resonite platform\n- Automatic material conversion\n- Optimized texture compression\n- Platform-specific optimizations\n\n[info]The system automatically handles texture conversion and compression during export to ensure compatibility.[/info]\n\n[warning]Some features may not transfer between all formats. Check platform requirements before exporting.[/warning]\n\n[note]For best results, use the recommended export format for your target platform.[/note]",
