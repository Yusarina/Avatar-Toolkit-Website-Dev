            "answer": "The material combination system intelligently merges similar materials to improve performance:\n\n### Material Detection\n- Analyzes all materials across meshes\n- Identifies materials with matching properties:\n  - Color values\n  - Texture assignments\n  - Shader settings\n  - Alpha properties\n\n### Combination Process\n- Preserves original material qualities\n- Merges identical textures\n- Consolidates similar material settings\n- Maintains UV mapping integrity\n\n### Cleanup Process\n- Removes unused material slots\n- Cleans up duplicate textures\n- Optimizes material assignments\n- Updates mesh references\n\n[info]This process can significantly reduce draw calls and improve performance.[/info]\n\n[note]The system preserves visual appearance while reducing material count.[/note]",

            "answer": "The mesh join system offers two powerful methods for combining meshes:\n\n### Join All Meshes\n- Combines all avatar meshes into one\n- Preserves all material assignments\n- Maintains vertex groups\n- Optimizes UV maps\n- Fixes mesh orientation\n\n### Join Selected Meshes\n- Combines only chosen meshes\n- Perfect for partial optimization\n- Maintains mesh properties\n- Preserves armature relationships\n\n### Automatic Optimizations\n- Fixes overlapping UVs\n- Maintains shape keys\n- Preserves vertex weights\n- Handles material slots\n\n[warning]Joining meshes is a permanent operation. Make a backup before proceeding.[/warning]\n\n[note]Joined meshes often perform better in-game due to reduced draw calls.[/note]",

            "answer": "The Remove Doubles system offers two powerful approaches for vertex optimization:\n\n### Standard Remove Doubles\n- Quick vertex merging\n- Handles basic mesh cleanup\n- Preserves shape keys\n- Maintains UV mapping\n- Automatic weight transfer\n\n### Advanced Remove Doubles\n- Progressive vertex processing\n- Shape key-aware merging\n- Precise distance threshold control\n- Selective vertex merging\n- Enhanced weight preservation\n\n### Key Features\n- Customizable merge distance\n- Shape key preservation\n- Weight painting protection\n- UV coordinate maintenance\n- Vertex group preservation\n\n[warning]Advanced Remove Doubles can take a long time to process. Blender will appear unresponsive during this operation and may seem frozen. Depending on your mesh complexity, this process can take up to an hour to complete. We recommend running Blender with the console window open to monitor the operation's progress. Performance improvements for this function are under development.[/warning]\n\n[info]Advanced mode is recommended for meshes with complex shape keys or detailed weight painting.[/info]\n\n[note]This optimization can significantly reduce vertex count while maintaining model quality.[/note]",
